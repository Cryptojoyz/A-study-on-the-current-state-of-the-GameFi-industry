### Abstract

Blockchain gaming is regarded as a new path for the future growth of the game industry. Cryptocurrencies have altered the world of virtual assets with the help of the blockchain system, enabling more players to take part in creating and sharing the value of the games. However, there are also views that blockchain games are just another type of Ponzi scheme. To gather the necessary variables for this article, we used Python to crawl CHAINPLAY. gg, a website that compiles information about blockchain games. In order to present the development status of blockchain games as completely as possible, we analyzed the game platform, game chain, game market cap, investor situation, investment platform situation, guilds situation, etc., in this article. Through analysis, we discovered that blockchain games are currently evolving in a very unbalanced "winner takes all" scenario.
